# `nmrstar-parser`: A Lightweight NMR-STAR Parser

This repository provides a minimal, dependency-light parser for [NMR-STAR](https://bmrb.io/spec/) format files from the Biological Magnetic Resonance Bank ([BMRB](https://bmrb.io/)). It extracts key biological and NMR data into convenient Python dictionaries and pandas DataFrames.

## Features

- Parse `.str` files into nested Python dictionaries
- Extract polymer sequences, sample compositions, and chemical shifts
- Built using Python standard library + `pandas`

## Installation

Clone this repo or copy `parser.py` into your project.

## Quickstart

See in Google colab [demo!](https://github.com/hkws-lab/NMRstar_parser/blob/main/nmrstar_parser_demo.ipynb)

```python
from parser import *

# Download an NMR-STAR file from BMRB
fetch_nmrstar_file(5363)  # saves as bmr5363_3.str

# Parse the file
entry = parse_nmr_star('bmr5363_3.str')

# Extract useful information
seq = get_sequences(entry)
samples = get_sample_info(entry)
cs = get_chem_shifts(entry)
```

## 🔎 Crash course on BMRB Attributes

To make sense of the structured data in NMR-STAR files, here are key categories you’ll encounter when parsing BMRB entries:

### 🗂️ Entry
The top-level object in a BMRB deposition. Each `.str` file represents one **entry**, corresponding to a single experiment or dataset deposited to the BMRB.

- Typically contains many **saveframes** describing samples, sequences, chemical shifts, and experimental conditions.

### 🔬 Entity
An **entity** refers to a distinct molecular species (e.g. a polypeptide, DNA, RNA, ligand, etc.) in the sample.

- Attributes often include:
  - `Polymer_type`: e.g. `polypeptide(L)`
  - `Polymer_seq_one_letter_code`: the primary sequence of the entity
  - `ID`: a numeric identifier used to cross-reference with samples and assignments

### 🧪 Sample
A **sample** is the physical material used in an NMR experiment, typically consisting of one or more entities in solution.

- The `sample` saveframe includes:
  - `Mol_common_name`: e.g. "Ubiquitin"
  - `Isotopic_labeling`: labeling strategy (e.g., `15N`, `13C`)
  - `Concentration_val`: numeric concentration
  - `_Sample_component`: a loop describing the components and their entity associations

### 📈 Chemical Shift List
This is typically found in `assigned_chemical_shifts` saveframes and includes experimental chemical shift data.

- The `_Atom_chem_shift` loop contains:
  - `Entity_ID`, `Seq_ID`, `Comp_ID`, `Atom_ID`
  - `Val`: chemical shift value (in ppm)
  - `Val_err`: uncertainty (in ppm)
  - Often accompanied by a `Name` for the dataset

## API Overview

### `fetch_nmrstar_file(bmrb_id)`
Downloads the version 3 NMR-STAR `.str` file from BMRB given a numeric ID.

### `parse_nmr_star(file_path)`
Parses the `.str` file into a nested dictionary organized by saveframe.

### `get_sequences(parsed)`
Returns a DataFrame summarizing polymer types and sequences from the parsed entry.

### `get_sample_info(parsed)`
Returns sample metadata including labeling and concentration info as a DataFrame.

### `get_chem_shifts(parsed)`
Extracts assigned chemical shifts into a DataFrame, including atom type, chemical shift, and associated metadata.
